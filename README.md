# Customer Churn Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer data to understand the underlying reasons behind "Customer Churn" - the point at which customers stop using the company's services. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we identify patterns, trends, and relationships that help the company make data-driven decisions to reduce churn and increase customer retention.

## 📊 Project Content
The `Customer_Churn_EDA.ipynb` file includes:
1.  **Data Importing and Cleaning:** Handling missing values and correcting data types.
2.  **Descriptive Analysis:** Exploring statistical distributions of variables (e.g., age, subscription type, contract duration).
3.  **Data Visualization:** Using libraries like `Plotly` and `Seaborn` to create interactive graphs showing the relationships between different variables and the target variable (Churn).
4.  **Key Insights:** Summary of the most significant factors influencing customer churn.

## 🛠 Tools and Libraries Used
* **Python**
* **Pandas & Numpy:** For data manipulation.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For static visualizations.
* **Plotly:** For interactive visualizations.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1.  Download the notebook file: `Customer_Churn_EDA.ipynb`.
2.  Ensure you have the dataset file: `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`.
3.  Update the data file path in the code to match where you save it on your local machine or workspace (e.g., Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook).
